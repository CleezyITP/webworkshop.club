 <h1>What all that code means</h1>

    <p>Elements inside the less-than and greater-than symbols are HTML tags. You will soon see the <em>html</em>, <em>head</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>body</em>, and <em>p</em> tags. Let's address these individually.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>html</strong> - This element goes at the beginning of every HTML page. It is closed with /html when you're finished with the file</li>
        <li><strong>head</strong> - This part of the file will contain information like the site's title, and any additional files you want to use, like CSS or javascript.</li> 
         <li><strong>title</strong> - This is the title of your webpage. The title tag, and it's closing tag, are between the head and the /head tags. Your screen reader will read the title of a page when it loads, but it is not displayed on the screen.</li>
         <li><strong>body</strong> - The body contains the content you will read off the screen. It is where you will put the majority of your content, text, audio, video, images, links, and so on. </li>
        <li><strong>p</strong> - This is a paragraph tag. Text will go between the two p tags (opening and closing) and will be displayed in the main browser window.</li>
    </ul>
