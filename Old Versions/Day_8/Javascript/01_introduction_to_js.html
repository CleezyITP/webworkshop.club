    <h1>Javascript basics</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS are called <em>markup languages</em>. They describe certain elements of a document. Javascript is a <em>programming language</em>. It allows you to change elements on the page based on user actions. Just like HTML and CSS, you can write javascript in notepad, and it will run in your browser.</p>

    <h2>The language</h2>
    <p>Javascript has some qualities that are different from CSS and HTML that are part of most programming languages. We'll discuss two of them, variables and functions.</p>
    
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>A variable is something you define in your program that can store a number or word that can change over time. Think of it like a backpack. You might have a computer in a backpack, or a shirt, or some food. you can change the contents whenever you like. Variables are used by programmers to store and change data over time. You can refer to a variable by its name to retrieve the information, or to set the information.</p>
    <p>You write a variable in javascript like this</p>
    <pre><code>var myVariableName = someValue ; </code></pre>
    

    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>Functions are pieces of code that do something. When you write a function, it becomes a collection of code that you can reuse over and over again.  You <em>invoke</em> a function by calling its name when an event happens. Web events might be selecting a button, loading a page, or entering text into a field.</p>
    <p>You write a function in javascript like this</p>
    <pre><code>
function myFunction() {
}</code></pre>
    
    <p>Your code to execute a change in the page would go inside the braces.</p>
    


    <h2>Accessing parts of a webpage</h2>
    <p>To change parts of a webpage, javascript has a way to talk to the elements in html. It can address elements by calling their name from a hierarchy that outlines the page's html elements, or through an id attribute. Think of it as javascript giving the webpage a shoulder tap and asking it to change something. You can change the content of any attribute or element in a page including text and styles.</p>
