<h1> Adding CSS to Your Page</h1>


<p> There are different ways you can incorporate CSS into your website. You can link to an external CSS file, you can write CSS directly  in the <em>head</em> of your page by using style tags, or you can write CSS as an attribute of an element. We will focus on creating our CSS in a separate CSS file (the best option for multi-page sites)</p>

<p> To link to a separate css file you fould first create a new file and save it win your website folder. You will need to save this file as a .css filetype. For example, "style.css". </p>

<p> Then, in your HTML, include a link to this file in between your &lt;head> tags. If the css file is in the same folder as your index page, the link should be written as follows: &lt;link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"></p>


<p> Let's break down the attributes in this new link element used to incorporate style in our sites: </p>

<ol>

<li>href - specifies the path to the CSS file. </li>
<li>type - specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.</li>
<li>rel - specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.</li>

</ol>

<p> in HTML:
<pre>&lt;html>
