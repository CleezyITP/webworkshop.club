<h1>Review of Attributes and Links</h1>

 <h2>Attributes</h2>
 <p>As a refresher, attributes are used to modify elements. Attributes are used in a number of ways and are useful when adding links (href), images (src), accessibility (alt), adding style with CSS and interactions with Javascript (id, class - we will learn more about later). previously, we used the reference attribute (href) to create links with the anchor element.</p>
 </p>

 <h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links are created by using the <em>anchor</em> element. Although we covered off on two last class, there are a many different kinds of links you can make. For example, you can create an anchor tag that links an external website, a file as part of your project folder, a section of your page, an email address/email client, or make an image an interactable link.
