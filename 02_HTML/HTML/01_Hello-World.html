    <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
    <h2>Coding as a recipe (a finicky sourdough recipe)</h2>
        <p>Computers need exact instructions. Code languages are just like a recipe, or set of instructions. If your computer doesn&apos;t understand something because of a typo or incorrect use of code, it can&apos;t do what you wish. If you do not understand something, you can always ask someone, but computers are less forgiving.</p>

    <h2>The index page</h2>

    <p>Websites have a special file for the first page you come to on a site. When you visit google.com or yahoo.com, or any domain at all, you're actually accessing a file named <em>index.html</em>.</p>
    <p>We'll make this index page in a few minutes, but first let's look at the structure of HTML, the markup language we'll be using.</p>
    <h2>HTML structure</h2>
    <p>HTML defines the structure of your webpages. The language contains different <em>elements</em>, each of which tells the browser something about itself. Elements are typically comprised of two <em>tags</em>. One opening tag and one closing tag. These tags are like containers for content. They surround the element they describe. </p>
        
        <p> As we mentioned earlier, it&apos;s useful to think of HTML as the bones of your site. Just like you, HTML contains a head and a body.</p>
