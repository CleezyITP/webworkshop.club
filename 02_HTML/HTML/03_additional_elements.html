    <h1>Additional HTML Elements</h1>
    <p>Now that we know how a website comes together with tags that describe the page's structure. The head and body tags provide a framework for you to add information in a logical fashion, and the p tag identifies a paragraph of text in the website. Let's look at some other elements that describe text in meaningful ways on the page</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>h1</strong> - HTML had six different kinds of <em>headings</em> to structure text on a page. h1 is for top level items, like the title of a page. You generally only want to use this once per page. <a href="03a_h1.html">h1 example</a></li>

        <li><strong>h2 h3 h4 h5 h6</strong> - each of these headings describes a different level of content. You can use these as much and as often as you like, but they should follow in order, that is, h3 will come under h2, and h2 will come under h1. As you know, your screen reader identifies each level as living under the one above it, so it's important to keep these structured. <a href="03b_h2_h6.html">h2 through h6 example</a> </li>

        <li><strong>ul</strong> - this element identifies that an <em>unordered list</em> is going to follow. A list is made up of any number of items. <a href="03c_ul.html">unordered list example</a></li>

        <li><strong>ol</strong> - this element identifies that an <em>ordered list</em> is going to follow. this type of list will automatically add an ascending number to each element in the list.<a href="03d_ol.html">ordered list example</a></li>

        <li><strong>li</strong> - this identifies a <em>list item</em>, or one element of a list.</li>


        <li><strong>comments</strong> - You can leave notes for yourself in HTML that the browser will ignore, and won't be rendered on the page. <a href="03f_comments.html">example with comments</a></li>
    </ul>
