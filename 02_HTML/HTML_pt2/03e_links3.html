<h1>Link with an accessible label</h1>
<p>Links should make sense out of context. Phrases such as &quot;click here,&quot; &quot;read more,&quot; and so on are ambiguous when read out of context.Â In some situations, designers may choose to lessen the visual appearance of links on a page by using shorter, repeated link text such as &quot;read more&quot;. These situations provide a good use case for aria-label in that the simpler, non-descriptive &quot;read more&quot; text on the page can be replaced with a more descriptive label of the link. The words &apos;read more&apos; are repeated in the aria-label (which replaces the original anchor text of [Read more...]) to allow consistent communication between users.
</p>

<a href="gotcha2.html" aria-label="Read more about the gotcha page">[Read more...]</a>
    
        <h2>HTML:</h2>
				<code>  				 
	    			&lt;a href=&quot;gotcha.html&quot; aria-label=&quot;Read more about the gotcha page&quot;>[Read more...]&lt;/a>		        		
				</code>

<p><strong>A note about keyboard accessibility:</strong> The most common source of keyboard inoperable links is when a developer decides to create custom elements and components (like a dynamic menu) by using JavaScript event handlers that do not permit keyboard access (eg on mouse over, or on hover). Links like this often have a pound sign as the link destination, which means that the link destination is the same page; clicking on the link accomplishes nothing.

<p> We will use links or anchor tags shortly. But first, let&apos;s learn a bit about how links can be used to create multipage sites.</p>
