<h1>Link with an accessible label</h1>
<p>In some situations, designers may choose to lessen the visual appearance of links on a page by using shorter, repeated link text such as "read more". These situations provide a good use case for aria-label in that the simpler, non-descriptive "read more" text on the page can be replaced with a more descriptive label of the link. The words 'read more' are repeated in the aria-label (which replaces the original anchor text of "[Read more...]") to allow consistent communication between users.
</p>

<a href="gotcha2.html" aria-label="Read more about the gotcha page">[Read more...]</a>
    
        <h2>HTML:</h2>
				<code>  				 
	    			&lt;a href=&quot;gotcha.html&quot; aria-label=&quot;Read more about the gotcha page&quot;>[Read more...]&lt;/a>		        		
				</code>

    <p> We will use links or anchor tags shortly. But first, let's learn a bit about how links can be used to create multipage sites.</p>
