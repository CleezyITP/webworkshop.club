<h1>Activity 1</h1> 

<p>Create a single page site using a heading, list and link. Use the page to explain an idea, or tell a story about yourself.</p>

<h2>Some site ideas to guide you</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Personal site - tell us a little about yourself!</li>
		<li>Special topic of your choosing - introduce the world to an area of interest with a general overview</li>
	</ol>
<p>Create a single web page for your choice. Begin by making a plan for what you want to include. When you have a plan, share it with the group! Please refer to the <a href="05_day 2 glossary.html">HTML Element Glossary</a> to help you choose and use elements!</p>

<p>Once we complete this activity, let's learn about creating multi-page sites. <a href="multipage_sites.html">Multipage sites.</a>
