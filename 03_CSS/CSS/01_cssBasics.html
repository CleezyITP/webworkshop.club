    <h1> CSS Basics</h1>
    
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. If HTML is the skeleton of your webpage, defining structure, CSS is the skin. It describes the visual style of a page. The syntax of the language is different from HTML and there are a number of different ways to use it.</p>

    <h2> Things you can do with CSS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>change font family</li>
        <li>font size</li>
        <li>alignment of elements, and text</li>
        <li>borders around elements</li>
        <li>change text and background color: We will discuss this as part of our work on web colors, color theory, and palette creation.</li>
        <li>and much more! </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Fonts and Font-Family</h2>

<h2>CSS Units of Measure</h2>

<p>The values of our CSS properties that deal in space and size are usually written in either pixel units (px), or ems. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text. </p>

<h3>Pixels</h3>

<p>Pixels are the smallest unit of a computer screen. The physical size of a pixel varies depending on your computer's resolution. For example, a laptop with a screen resolution of 2560 by 1600, may have a pixel density of 227 pixels per inch, or PPI. This means an object on the screen that is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high will be roughly size of a US quarter on this laptop screen.
</p>

<h3> Ems</h3>

<p>Ems is a unit that is relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font). Ems are calculated as a percentage of the font sized used. The average browser renders paragraph fonts at 16px, so if you change the font size of your paragraphs to 2em, they will be 32px.</p>
