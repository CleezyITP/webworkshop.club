<h1>Color Schemes</h1>
Here we will cover the traditional color scheme patterns (monochrome, analogous, complementary, etc.) as well as how to create custom schemes that aren’t based strictly on any one pattern. 

<h2>Traditional Color Scheme Types</h2>

<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
<p>Monochromatic color schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints within a specific hue. These are the simplest color schemes to create, as they’re all taken from the same hue. Monochromatic schemes are easy to create, but can also be boring when done poorly. Adding in a strong neutral like white or black can help keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of monochrome color schemes. For the most part with these schemes, the first color (from left to right) would likely be used for headlines. The second color would be used for body text or possibly the background. The third color would likely be used for the background (or body text if color #2 was used as the background). And the last two colors would be used as accents or within graphics.</p>

<h4>Red Monochromatic</h4>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFCCCC</td> <td>255, 204, 204</td> <td>80% lighter than red (close to the web color name Pink)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FF6666</td> <td>255, 102, 102</td> <td>40% lighter than red (close to the web color name Tomato)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FF0000</td> <td>255, 0, 0</td> <td>Red</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#990000</td> <td>153, 0, 0</td> <td>40% darkened than red (close to the web color name DarkRed)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#330000</td> <td>51, 0, 0</td> <td>80% darkened than red (close to the web color name Black)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<h4>Blue Monochromatic</h4>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#CCCCFF</td> <td>204, 204, 255</td> <td>80% lighter than blue (somewhat like the web color name CornflowerBlue)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#6666FF </td> <td>102, 102, 255</td> <td>40% lighter than blue (somewhat like the web color name RoyalBlue)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#0000FF</td> <td>0, 0, 255</td> <td>Blue</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#000099</td> <td>0, 0, 153</td> <td>40% darker than blue (close to DarkBlue)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#000033</td> <td>0, 0, 51</td> <td>80% darker than blue (close to Black)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>



<h4>Cyan Monochromatic</h4>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#CCFFFF</td><td>204, 255, 255</td><td>80% lighter than Cyan (close to the web color name LightCyan)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#66FFFF</td><td>102, 255, 255</td><td>40% lighter than Cyan (somewhat like Turquoise)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#00FFFF</td><td>0, 255, 255</td><td>Cyan</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#009999</td><td>0, 153, 153</td><td>40% darker than Cyan (close to DarkCyan)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#003333</td><td>0, 51, 51</td><td>80% darker than Cyan (close to the web color name DarkSlateGray or Black)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>


<h3>Analogous</h3>
<p>Analogous color schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel. You can add more than 3 colors to analogous schemes by lightening or darkening colors on the outside of color triplets.</p>

<p>In order to create the following examples of analagous color scheme, we picked three web colors for the analogous scheme.</p>

<h4>Red-Purple, Red, Red-Orange</h4>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#800080</td>
			<td>128, 0, 128</td>
			<td>Red-Purple</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FF0000</td>
			<td>255, 0, 0</td>
			<td>Red</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FF8C00</td>
			<td>255, 140, 0</td>
			<td>Dark Orange</td>
		</tr>
	</table>


<h4>Yellow Green, Green, Blue-Green</h4>

<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFFF98</td>
			<td>255, 255, 152</td>
			<td>40% lighter than YellowGreen (close to the web color name LemonChiffon)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#9ACD32</td>
			<td>154, 205, 50</td>
			<td>YellowGreen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#008000</td>
			<td>0, 128, 0</td>
			<td>Green</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#4682B4</td>
			<td>70, 130, 180</td>
			<td>SteelBlue</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#001C4E</td>
			<td>0, 28, 78</td>
			<td>40% darker than SteelBlue (close to the web color name MidnightBlue)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<h3>Complementary</h3>

<p>Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel. In their most basic form, these schemes consist of only two colors. A word of warning, though: using colors that are exact opposites (without adjusting lightness/darkness) right next to each other can be visually jarring. They will appear to vibrate along their border in the most severe cases. This is best avoided (either by leaving negative space or by adding another, transitional color between them.</p>
<p>The following schemes are created by picking two web colors for the complementary scheme, and lightened/darkened them.</p>

<h4>Blue-Orange</h4> 
<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFFFCC</td>
			<td>255, 255, 204</td>
			<td>80% lighter than Orange (close to the web color nameCornsilk)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFA500</td>
			<td>255, 165, 0</td>
			<td>Orange</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#0000FF</td>
			<td>0, 0, 255</td>
			<td>Blue</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#000099</td>
			<td>0, 0, 153</td>
			<td>40 % darker than Blue (close to DarkBlue)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#000033</td>
			<td> 0, 0, 51</td>
			<td>80 % darker than Blue (close to Black)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>


<h4>Yellow-Purple</h4> 
<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Hex</th>
			<th>RGB</th>
			<th>Color</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFCCFF</td>
			<td>255, 204, 255</td>
			<td>80% lighter than Purple (close to Plum)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#800080</td>
			<td>128, 0, 128</td>
			<td>Purple</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#FFFF00</td>
			<td>255, 255, 0</td>
			<td>Yellow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#999900</td>
			<td>153, 153, 0</td>
			<td>40 % darkened from Yellow (close to Olive)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#333300</td>
			<td>51, 51, 0</td>
			<td>80 % darkened from Yellow (close to black)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
