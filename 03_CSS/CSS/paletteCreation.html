<h1>Creating a Color Scheme</h1>
Here we will cover the traditional color scheme patterns (monochrome, analogous, complementary, etc.) as well as how to create custom schemes that aren’t based strictly on any one pattern. 

<h2>Traditional Color Scheme Types</h2>

<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
<p>Monochromatic color schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints within a specific hue. These are the simplest color schemes to create, as they’re all taken from the same hue. Monochromatic schemes are easy to create, but can also be boring when done poorly. Adding in a strong neutral like white or black can help keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of monochrome color schemes. For the most part with these schemes, the first color (from left to right) would likely be used for headlines. The second color would be used for body text or possibly the background. The third color would likely be used for the background (or body text if color #2 was used as the background). And the last two colors would be used as accents or within graphics.</p>

<h4>Red</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>#FFCCCC, 255 204 204, 80% lightened from the center. (close to Pink)</li>
		<li>#FF6666, 255 102 102, 40 % lightened from the center.  (close to Tomato)</li>
		<li>#FF0000, 255 0 0, Red</li>
		<li>#990000, 153 0 0, 40% darkened from the center. (close to DarkRed)</li>
		<li>#330000, 51 0 0, 80% darkened from the center. (close to Black)</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Blue</h4>
#CCCCFF, 204 204 255, 80% lightened from the center. (super difficult but I would say CornflowerBlue)
#6666FF, 102 102 255, 40 % lightened from the center. (super difficult but I would say RoyalBlue)
#0000FF, 0 0 255, Blue
#000099, 0 0 153, 40% darkened from the center. (close to DarkBlue)
#000033, 0 0 51, 80% darkened from the center. (close to Black)


<h4>Cyan</h4>
#CCFFFF, 204 255 255, 80% lightened from the center. (close to LightCyan)
#66FFFF, 102 255 255, 40 % lightened from the center. (super difficult but I would say Turquoise)
#00FFFF, 0 255 255, Cyan
#009999, 0 153 153, 40% darkened from the center. (close to DarkCyan)
#003333, 0 51 51, 80% darkened from the center. (close to DarkSlateGray or Black)


<h3>Analogous</h3>
<p>Analogous color schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel. Traditionally, analogous color schemes all have the same chroma level, but by adjusting tones, shades, and tints adapt them to our needs for designing websites.</p>

<p>In order to create the following examples of analagous color scheme, we picked three web colors for the analogous scheme, and lightened/darkened two of them.</p>

Red centered
#FFCCFF, 255 204 255, 80% lightened from Purple (close to Plum)
#800080, 128 0 128, Purple
#FF0000, 255 0 0, Red
#FF8C00, 255 140 0, DarkOrange
#330000, 51 0 0, 80% darkened from DarkOrange (close to Black)

Blue centered
#CCFFFF, 204 255 255, 40% lightened from MediumAquamarine (close to PaleTurquoise)
#66CDAA, 102 205 170, MediumAquamarine
#0000FF, 0 0 255, Blue
#483D8B,72 61 139, DarkSlateBlue
#000025, 0 0 37, 40% darkened from DarkSlateBlue. (close to Black)

Green centered
#FFFF98, 255 255 152, 40% lightened from YellowGreen (close to LemonChiffon)
#9ACD32, 154 205 50, YellowGreen
#008000, 0 128 0, Green
#4682B4, 70 130 180, SteelBlue
#001C4E, 0 28 78, 40% darkened from SteelBlue (close to Black or MidnightBlue)


<h3>Complementary</h3>
Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel. In their most basic form, these schemes consist of only two colors, but can be expanded using tones, tints, and shades.
A word of warning, though: using colors that are exact opposites with the same chroma and/or value right next to each other can be visually jarring (they’ll appear to actually vibrate along their border in the most severe uses). This is best avoided (either by leaving negative space or by adding another, transitional color between them).
KEITA: I picked two web colors for the complementary scheme, and lightened/darkened them.

<h4>Red-Green palette:</h4> 
#99FF99, 153 255 153,  60% lightened from Green (close to PaleGreen)
#008000, 0 128 0, Green
#FF0000, 255 0 0, Red
#990000, 153 0 0, 40 % darkened from Red (close to DarkRed)
#330000, 51 0 0 , 80% darkened from Red (close to Black)

<h4>Blue-Orange</h4> (Linen - Orange - Blue - DarkBlue - DarkBlue 30% darkened)
#FFFFCC, 255 255 204, 80% lightened from Orange (close to Cornsilk)
#FFA500, 255 165 0, Orange
#0000FF, 0 0 255, Blue
#000099, 0 0 153, 40 % darkened from Blue (close to DarkBlue)
#000033, 0 0 51, 80 % darkened from Blue (close to Black)


<h4>Yellow-Purple</h4> (Purple 80% lightened - Purple - Yellow - DarkKhaki - DarkKhaki 50% darkened)
#FFCCFF, 255 204 255, 80% lightened from Purple (close to Plum)
#800080,128 0 128, Purple
#FFFF00, 255 255 0, Yellow
#999900, 153 153 0, 40 % darkened from Yellow (close to Olive)
#333300, 51 51 0, 80 % darkened from Yellow (close to black)



<h2>Creating A Color Scheme</h2>

<h3>How Many Colors</h3>
<p>Five is a good number that gives plenty of options for illustrating the concepts here, and it’s a workable number in a design. But feel free to have more or fewer colors in your own schemes. A lot of websites might only use three colors in their designs. Others use only two. And some might use eight or ten (which is a lot trickier than using fewer colors). 
</p>

Simple color workflow that you can use in your next web project.

Creating A Cohesive Color Palette
We will add three neutral colors to every scheme:
white,
dark gray,
light gray.

In addition to these colors, all you really need are two colors: a base color, and an accent color 

If you can create a website using only these five colors, you’ll get a much better result than if you were to go overboard with complementaries, split-complementaries, triads and the rest.

<h3>Choosing A Base Color</h3>

<p>Now, picking a color out of the blue (pun intentional) would be quite easy, but we’re not going to do that. For any project in which you’re dealing with clients, you should really try to justify as many of your choices as you can. Don’t overthink it. Just make sure you have some kind of reasoning behind your color choice (and every choice, for that matter). 
</p>
Use what you have. If you have a logo with an established color, that will usually be your starting color.
Eliminate your competitors’ colors. If one of your main competitors has a strong brand color, don’t copy it if you can help it. Find your competitors’ colors to eliminate them from your own color schemes.
Think about your target audience. The colors of a website for a funeral home would likely be very different from the colors for a kids club. Think about who will be using the website and how you want them to feel (excited, serious, taken care of, etc.).
But don’t default to stereotypes. If you’re designing a website for young girls, you don’t have to use pink. Avoid clichés to gain credibility.

You should now have a base color in mind for the design. It should be something simple like red, green, blue, yellow or pink. 

FINDING YOUR ACCENT
Your accent color will be used in very small amounts on your website, usually as a call to action. So, it needs to stand out.


Now, we’ve got a nice base color and a shot of an accent. Let’s add white to the mix, because white is always good. All that’s missing now are some grays.

ADDING THE GRAY
For most of my web projects, I find having two shades of gray to be infinitely useful — one dark, one light. You’ll use them a lot.

The dark is usually used for text, and the light for when you need subtle differentiation against all that white (usually for backgrounds).

You can choose your grays in one of two ways:

You could use Dribbble and Designspiration again to find a nice gray from your previous results that matches your base color. But usually it’s easier to type blue website in the search bar, which will show more grays in the results.
If you have Photoshop or the like, you could use Erica Schoonmaker’s technique to harmonize your grays with the base color.

CREATING HARMONIOUS GRAYS
To get our shiny new harmonious grays using Erica’s method, we’ll start by picking two default grays out of a hat. Then, follow these steps:

Create two shapes and fill them with #424242 and #fafafa.
Insert a color fill layer above your two shapes.
Change that fill to your base color (#30c9e8).
Set the blending mode to overlay, and bring the opacity right down to between 5 and 40% (in the example below, it’s set at 40%).
Use the color picker and copy your new values.

I should point out that this method works exceptionally well when your overlay color is blue. For any other color, you will want to either bring the opacity right down to 5 to 10% or stick with your original grays.

4. Applying Your Color Scheme
Now that we’ve got our color scheme, it’s time to apply it. This is a whole other article unto itself. But to give you an idea, here’s a mockup of a page design in grayscale and with the colors applied.

Tip: If you struggle with color, a good trick is to create your website layout in grayscale first. Figure out the hierarchy, and then experiment with the color later.

(Don’t skip putting the colors in your icons. It’s a small detail but makes a big difference.)

The white and light gray form the background. The light gray doesn’t have to be here at all, but I find it is another small detail that really makes a website look polished.

It is important to note that when using color and text you need to ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the background and the copy. This will help people with color blindness or low vision read the text on your website. There are many tools you can use - two popular ones are the WebAim Color Contrast Checker and Contrast Ratio by Lea Verou.


Color Guide Final Note
As you can see, we really don’t need much more than the palette we’ve created today. But that doesn’t mean you are limited to these colors, oh no!


(Using the techniques above, you can extend your color palette to hold more colors as and when you need them)

As you’re designing, you might decide it’s appropriate to introduce some more colors to your palette. That’s totally fine! As long as you’re attentive, you can use the steps above to find more colors that work with your scheme.
