    <h1>Box Model</h1>

<p>CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box (we have a tactile demonstration). You can set several properties that affect the appearance/dimensions of these boxes.</p>

<p> The properties of the box we can control with CSS are element margins, and padding
for each box with CSS. Here is a breakdown of what each means:</p>

<ol> 
<li>Padding -
Padding is the space between
the content and border of a box.
Adding padding increases the total size of an element can increase the
readability of its contents.
</li>
<li> Border -
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border can be used to form a visual outline of content, and 
separates the edge of one box
from another. The border-style property can be set to solid, dotted, and double. 
</li>
<li>
Margin -
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes. Margins impact the spacing between elements.
</li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<h2> Pixels</h2>

<p>The values of these properties are usually written in pixel units (px), but sometimes also in percentages (percentages of the screen), or em (relative to other elements). Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text. </p>

<p>Pixels are the smallest unit of a computer screen. The physical size of a pixel varies depending on your computer's resolution. For example, a laptop with a screen resolution of 2560 by 1600, may have a pixel density of 227 pixels per inch, or PPI. This means an object on the screen that is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high will be roughly size of a US quarter on this laptop screen.
