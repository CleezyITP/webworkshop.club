		<h1>Color Theory</h1>
		Something as simple as changing color can evoke a completely different feeling on a website. Although color use is somewhat subjective, Color Theory can help us create a common language/conventions about colors. 

		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<h3>Color Wheel</h3>
		<p>
			Color wheels provide us with a way to show the relationships between primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors. This system is the basis of color pairings methods and scheme creation. The wheel forms a circle of colors that
			clockwise from top, go red, red-orange, orange, orange-yellow,
			yellow, yellow-green, green, blue-green, blue, blue-purple, purple,
			and purple-red. Red, yellow and blue are primary colors - meaning
			that when mixing these colors (eg paints, and inks), all other
			colors can be obtained by mixing them. Orange, green, and purple are
			secondary colors - meaning that they are made of a mix of primary
			colors. Red-orange, orange-yellow, yellow-green, blue-green,
			blue-purple, and purple-red are tertiary colors - meaning they are
			formed by blending primary and secondary colors. The label cool is
			in the bottom left (near yellow-green, green, blue-green, blue,
			blue-purple, purple), and the label warm is in the top right (near
			Red, red-orange, orange, orange-yellow, yellow).

		<h4>Relationship</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Complementary: Complementary colors are any two colors which are directly opposite each other, such as red and green and red-purple and yellow-green.</li>
			<li>Analagous: Analogous colors are any three colors which are side by side on a 12-part color wheel, such as yellow-green, yellow, and yellow-orange. Usually one of the three colors predominates.</li>
			
		</ul>

		<h3>Color Psychology</h3>
