    <h1>Selectors</h1>
    <p>CSS can address or select elements on a page in many different ways. Some of the most common ways are as follows: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Type or Element selector</strong>: You can apply a style to every element of a paricular type. For example, you can have the text in contents of the body be arial type font:</li>
            
            <pre>
body{
    font-family: Arial;
}
            </pre>

            <li><strong>Class</strong>: You can apply visual style to a specific html elements by adding the class attribute. You may call your class by any name, as an example, you can write class attributes like this: class="important". Classes allow you to target specific elements and modify them. This is often used with the <em>div</em> element for layout purposes. </li>

            <pre>
.important{
    font-family: Arial;
}
            </pre>

            <li><strong>ID</strong> : You can also apply visual style to a specific html elements by adding the I D attribute. I Ds give you the ability to change style and content using Javascript. I Ds are useful for adressing specific elements with unique I D s and therefore, you should only use an I D once.</li>

            
            <pre>
#top{
     font-family: Arial;
}
            </pre>

        </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If I want to do the same thing to a couple of elements I can add those add more elements to my selector with a comma seperating them. For example, if I want to update all my heading levels to be in Verdana, I would write the following: 
<pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family:Verdana;
}  
</pre> 

Element, ID, and Class selectors can be combined with a space seperating them to get really specific about the elements you want to apply style to. For example, if I want to style the list items in my navigation differently than the other list items on my site, I can give my navigation opening tag a class attribute and combine class and element selectors in my CSS. 

Here is what my HTML could be:
<pre>
&lt;nav class=&apos;main-nav&apos;>
    &lt;ul>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href=&apos;about&apos;.html>about&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
    &lt;/ul>
&lt;/nav>
</pre>
And here is what my CSS would be: 
<pre>
.main-nav li{
    padding:2%;
}
</pre>
</p>
