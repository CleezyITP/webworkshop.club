<h2>Creating A Color Scheme</h2>

<h3>How Many Colors</h3>
<p>Five is a good number that gives plenty of options for illustrating the concepts here, and it’s a workable number in a design. But feel free to have more or fewer colors in your own schemes. A lot of websites might only use three colors in their designs. Others use only two. And some might use eight or ten (which is a lot trickier than using fewer colors). 
</p>

Simple color workflow that you can use in your next web project.

Creating A Cohesive Color Palette
We will add three neutral colors to every scheme:
white,
dark gray,
light gray.

In addition to these colors, all you really need are two colors: a base color, and an accent color 

If you can create a website using only these five colors, you’ll get a much better result than if you were to go overboard with complementaries, split-complementaries, triads and the rest.

<h3>Choosing A Base Color</h3>

<p>Now, picking a color out of the blue (pun intentional) would be quite easy, but we’re not going to do that. For any project in which you’re dealing with clients, you should really try to justify as many of your choices as you can. Don’t overthink it. Just make sure you have some kind of reasoning behind your color choice (and every choice, for that matter). 
</p>
Use what you have. If you have a logo with an established color, that will usually be your starting color.
Eliminate your competitors’ colors. If one of your main competitors has a strong brand color, don’t copy it if you can help it. Find your competitors’ colors to eliminate them from your own color schemes.
Think about your target audience. The colors of a website for a funeral home would likely be very different from the colors for a kids club. Think about who will be using the website and how you want them to feel (excited, serious, taken care of, etc.).
But don’t default to stereotypes. If you’re designing a website for young girls, you don’t have to use pink. Avoid clichés to gain credibility.

You should now have a base color in mind for the design. It should be something simple like red, green, blue, yellow or pink. 

FINDING YOUR ACCENT
Your accent color will be used in very small amounts on your website, usually as a call to action. So, it needs to stand out.


Now, we’ve got a nice base color and a shot of an accent. Let’s add white to the mix, because white is always good. All that’s missing now are some grays.

ADDING THE GRAY
For most of my web projects, I find having two shades of gray to be infinitely useful — one dark, one light. You’ll use them a lot.

The dark is usually used for text, and the light for when you need subtle differentiation against all that white (usually for backgrounds).

You can choose your grays in one of two ways:

You could use Dribbble and Designspiration again to find a nice gray from your previous results that matches your base color. But usually it’s easier to type blue website in the search bar, which will show more grays in the results.
If you have Photoshop or the like, you could use Erica Schoonmaker’s technique to harmonize your grays with the base color.

CREATING HARMONIOUS GRAYS
To get our shiny new harmonious grays using Erica’s method, we’ll start by picking two default grays out of a hat. Then, follow these steps:

Create two shapes and fill them with #424242 and #fafafa.
Insert a color fill layer above your two shapes.
Change that fill to your base color (#30c9e8).
Set the blending mode to overlay, and bring the opacity right down to between 5 and 40% (in the example below, it’s set at 40%).
Use the color picker and copy your new values.

I should point out that this method works exceptionally well when your overlay color is blue. For any other color, you will want to either bring the opacity right down to 5 to 10% or stick with your original grays.

4. Applying Your Color Scheme
Now that we’ve got our color scheme, it’s time to apply it. This is a whole other article unto itself. But to give you an idea, here’s a mockup of a page design in grayscale and with the colors applied.

Tip: If you struggle with color, a good trick is to create your website layout in grayscale first. Figure out the hierarchy, and then experiment with the color later.

(Don’t skip putting the colors in your icons. It’s a small detail but makes a big difference.)

The white and light gray form the background. The light gray doesn’t have to be here at all, but I find it is another small detail that really makes a website look polished.

It is important to note that when using color and text you need to ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the background and the copy. This will help people with color blindness or low vision read the text on your website. There are many tools you can use - two popular ones are the WebAim Color Contrast Checker and Contrast Ratio by Lea Verou.


Color Guide Final Note
As you can see, we really don’t need much more than the palette we’ve created today. But that doesn’t mean you are limited to these colors, oh no!


(Using the techniques above, you can extend your color palette to hold more colors as and when you need them)

As you’re designing, you might decide it’s appropriate to introduce some more colors to your palette. That’s totally fine! As long as you’re attentive, you can use the steps above to find more colors that work with your scheme.

    
    <p> Let's try and pull together some new ideas into your CSS file. First, develop a color palette/scheme for your site based on color theory descriptions. This palette is 100% up to you to create, but please be prepared to describe your rationale, and test your foreground and background colors using either <a href='https://www.levelaccess.com/color-contrast-checker/'>The Level Access Contrast Checker</a> (accepts RGB and Hex values) or <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Webaim&apos;s contrast analyzer</a> (Hex only). Use Divs, and your existing HTML elements to implement your new color scheme.</p>
