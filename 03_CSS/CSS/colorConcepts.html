		<h1>Color Concepts</h1>
		<h2>Terminology</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Hue: what color something is, like blue or red</li>
			<li>
				Chrome: how pure a color is, the lack of white, black or gray
				added to it
			</li>
			<li>Saturation: the strength or weakness of a color</li>
			<li>Value: how light or dark a color is</li>
			<li>Tone:created by adding gray to a pure hue</li>
			<li>Shade: created by adding black to a pure hue</li>
			<li>Tint:created by adding white to a hue</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Base and Accent colors</h2>
		In order to understand the use of color on the web in a practical way,
		it is important to identify the difference between background, base and
		accent colors:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Background Color: This color is typically the most dominant and
				sets the general look and feel of the site. The default
				background is white. Some common examples are white, black, grey
				and blue.
			</li>
			<li>
				Base Color(s): This color is used to break up the background
				color and is often a neutral color (white, grey, brown, and
				black colors). The base color normally contrasts with the
				background, and is used in menu elements, titles, subtitles,
				blocks of text and sometimes images/illustrations. A common
				example is a website with a white background dark grey base.
			</li>
			<li>
				Accent Color: This color is used least but gives the site its
				personality. Your accent color is distinct from background and
				the base colors - and is typically the boldest color. The accent
				is typically found in logos, buttons, links, and sometimes
				headings, images, or illustrations. An example is a website with
				white background, the title and texts are dark grey and there is
				a big button in color red that reads “buy here”.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Color Contrast</h2>

		<p>
			WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
			between fore and background colors, for normal text sizes (10-17px),
			and 3:1 for large text (24px). WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of
			at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (like
			buttons, inputs, and links). You can check the contrast of your
			color choices by using

				>WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker</a
			>.
