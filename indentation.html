<h1>Announcing Indentation</h1>
<p>Big thank you to Ka Li for sharing these resources!</p>

<h2>Jaws Speech and Sounds Schemes</h2>

<p>In JAWS, Speech and Sound Schemes can be used to assign notes to different indentation levels, or have JAWS announce is verbally. Check out <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/SurfsUp/Speech_Sounds_Schemes.htm">Freedom Scientific&apos;s Sound Scheme Documentation</a></p>

<h2>NVDA Beeps and  Speech</h2>
<p>NVDA doesn't have as much flexibility but it can read indents, line
numbers and other formatting info under document formatting settings.
You can access it with control-NVDA Key-d or navigate to it through NVDA
menu>preferences>settings>document formatting. If you want NVDA to
announce indentation, tab over to line indentation. From there, you can
change it to beeps, speech, or both.</p>
