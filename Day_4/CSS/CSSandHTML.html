    <h1>Incorporate CSS into Your HTML</h1>

    <p>
        Once you've added a link to an extrernal stylesheet, there are a couple ways to incoprorate your styles into your HTML.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Element selectors : any HTML element you have created a rule for will be applied to the HTML elements autoatically</li>
        <li>class selectors : class selectors you have defined in your CSS file can be referred to in your HTML with the <em>class</em> attribute. If you have a class selector defined as
            <pre>.myBigClass { 
    font-size:72px;
}</pre>you would call it in your code as
            <pre>&lt;p class="myBigClass"></pre>
        </li>
        <li>I D selectors : an I D selector is called once. I D selectors you have defined in your CSS file can be referred to in your HTML with the <em>id</em> attribute. If you have a I D selector defined as
            <pre>#banana { 
    background-color:yellow;
}
        </pre>you would call it in your code as
            <pre>&lt;div id="banana"></pre> </li>
    </ul>
