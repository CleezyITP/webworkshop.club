    <h1>Selectors</h1>
    <p>CSS can address or select elements on a page in many different ways. Some of the most common ways are as follows: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Type or Element selector</strong>: You can apply a style to every element of a paricular type. For example, you can have the text in contents of the body be arial type font:</li>
            
            <pre>
                body{
                font-family: Arial;
            }
            </pre>

            <li><strong>Class</strong>: You can apply visual style to a specific html elements by adding the class attribute. You may call your class by any name, as an example, you can write class attributes like this: class="important". Classes allow you to target specific elements and modify them. This is often used with the <em>div</em> element for layout purposes. </li>

            <pre>
                .important {
                font-family: Arial;
            }
            </pre>

            <li><strong>ID</strong> : You can also apply visual style to a specific html elements by adding the I D attribute. I Ds give you the ability to change style and content using Javascript. I Ds are useful for adressing specific elements with unique I D s and therefore, you should only use an I D once.</li>

            
            <pre>
                #top {
                font-family: Arial;
            }
            </pre>

        </ol>
    </p>
