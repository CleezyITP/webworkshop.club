<h1>Usability and Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>When a developer is thoughtful during the planning stage, uses conventions/common patterns, and tests their work early and often - they are taking the necessary steps to ensure the usability of their website. </p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Good web developers know that there is a strong overlap between usability and accessibility. The main design principles behind the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. When we keep these principles in mind and use accessibility best practices, they go a long way to ensure users with a range of abilities can use the content we create. In this course, we will be using native and semantic HTML elements to ensure content and structure are relayed to screen reader users and are keyboard operable, creating descriptive link text and element labels, adding alternative text descriptions to images we use, using a color contrast analyzer to ensure colors we use have sufficient contrast, and using ARIA to communicate dynamic content updates via JavaScript.</p>
