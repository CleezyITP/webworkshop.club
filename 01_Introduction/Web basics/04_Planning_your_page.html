    <h1>Planning your site</h1>

    <p>When you create a website, it is important to plan it out. Many web designers engage in a practice called <em>wireframing</em>. This process is often supported by using visual metaphors for the parts of a website and how they fit together. This planning process is also useful for designers to determine the layout of a page and how people will interact with the page. Planning a whole site or single page can be done by creating a list of pages you want to be on your site and description for each. Ultimately, it's a way of being goal oriented, describing information in a logical way, and giving some thought to the experience of the user.</p>

<p>In planning your site you should give some consideration to the following questions: 

<ul>
	<li>What is the goal of your website? </li>
	<li>How are you communicating that goal to your users?</li>
	<li>What information is important for users to have?</li>
	<li>In what order should the information be presented? </li>
	<li> What are the core tasks or activities do you want your user to be able to perform?</li>
	<li>What are the steps required and what types of interactions should be included?</li> 
</ul>

In addition to answering these questions for yourself, bouncing your ideas off of others and having them give you feedback helps a lot with this process.</p>
