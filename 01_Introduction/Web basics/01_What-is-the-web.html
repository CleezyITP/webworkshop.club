    <h1>What is the web?</h1>

    <h2>A subset of the internet</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web is part of a larger global network known as the internet. The Internet consists of interconnected computer networks that are "linked by electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#:~:text=The%20Internet%20is%20the%20global,communicate%20between%20networks%20and%20devices.&text=The%20primary%20precursor%20network%2C%20the,military%20networks%20in%20the%201970s.">Wikipedia</a>). Web pages are files of content that are primarily text, but can contain images, videos, and audio files. They are linked through a technology called hypertext. Hypertext can be either static like a paragraph you read on a news website, or used to create complex and dynamic systems with links and cross-references.</p>
   
    <h2>How does the web work?</h2>
    <p>Web servers are specialized computers that are always connected to the internet, and are configured to send web pages to browsers when requested. To operate a web server, you typically buy space from a <em>web hosting</em> company, but it is possible to host pages in other ways too.</p>

    <p>People access the web through software called a <em>web browser</em>, you've probably used one already. Let's break down the steps in how the browser renders a page.
        <ul>
            <li>A user either follows a link, opens a bookmark, or types in a <em>URL</em> in the address bar of their browser</li>
            <li>The browser makes a request to the network, which routes the request to the <em>web server</em> the resource is located on.</li>
            <li>The server replies with a page and any affiliated content (such as images, video files, styling, interactive scripts)</li>
            <li>When the browser receives the content, it reads through the files and renders the page and its content</li>
        </ul>
