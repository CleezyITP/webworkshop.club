        <h1>Beginner&apos;s Guide to Debugging Javascript</h1>

        <p>
            &quot;Debugging is the process of turning mysteries into
            errors&quot; - Clay Shirky
        </p>

        <p>
            Debugging refers to different methods and tools for checking your
            assumptions and finding errors in your code. Here are a few
            strategies that do not require use of advanced tools to help in the process.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Always check for spelling and syntax errors. Do so carefully -
                line by line, and character by character. I cannot stress how
                easy it is to break your code with errors that are the product
                of a missing character like a semi-colon.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Take a breath, or a break and work methodically. Examine your
                code section by section, function by function. If you have not
                already, add comments to your code (// in javascript), and
                describe what each part is doing. If your code was working
                before, and is now broken, reflect on what has most recently
                changed and focus on this section.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                If you are on your own, try the Rubber Ducking method.

                <p>
                    This technique requires you describe the parts of your code
                    to a rubber duck, or other inanimate object. Many programmers
                    have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone
                    else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about
                    programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the
                    process of explaining the problem. In describing what the
                    code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does,
                    any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. More generally, explaining a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper
                    understanding. By using an inanimate object, the programmer
                    can try to accomplish this without the help of anyone else.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                In addition to using the chrome developer tools (f12 and locating the console tab), you can bypass this unruly interface by adding the
                following code into the beginning of your script to extract
                developer tool error messages and turn them into an alert:
                <pre>
window.onerror = showerror;
function showerror(msg, url, line, column, rerr){
 alert('Error: ' + msg + ' Line: ' + line + ' character: ' + column + ' url ' + url + ' ' + rerr);
 window.onerror=null;  
 return true;  
}
            </pre
                >

                This script should run once your javascript is called (eg after
                a button press), and detect errors one at a time. If you cannot
                decipher what is happening from this error message, copy the
                alert message, delete the line number information, and search it
                online!
