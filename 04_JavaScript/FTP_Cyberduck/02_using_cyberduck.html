    <h1>How to open a connection to a remote server</h1>

 <p><em>Cyberduck</em> works reasonably well with JAWS, which is why we'll be using it. There are other ways to connect to a sever, but we think this one is professional and should work well for you.</p>
    
    <p>Before you can put files on your server, you need to make a connection between your computer and the server. The following steps will take you through this process.</p>
 
    <ol>
        <li>Unfortunatley, there's no notification when cyberduck first opens. Open Cyberduck and wait a few moments after opening the application, then press <em>Insert + B</em> to read the current window. If JAWS is focused on and reads cyberduck, you can move ahead.</li>
        <li>Type <em>Control + O</em></li>
        <li>You will automatically be in a field named <em>Server :</em> enter your server name here</li>
        <li>press <em>Tab</em> two times to the <em>Username</em> field and enter your username</li>
        <li>press <em>Tab</em> once. You will be in the password field. Enter your password.</li>
        <li>Press enter</li>
        <li> you will get a dialog box that notifies you that your connection is insecure. This is ok. Select <em>connect</em>.</li>
        <li>after a few moments you will connect to your server. Once it connects it will read out the name of a folder. This folder should be your name. There are two other folders named <em>logs</em> and <em>maildir</em>, but you shoud ignore those. select the folder with your name.</li>
        <li>wait for about 15 seconds after opening the folder with your name. If you use the up and down arrows, JAWS should read a file name, <em>index.html</em>. This is the index of your website!</li>
    </ol>
