    <h1>FTP</h1>

 <p>So far, we have been working with webpages that are on our computers, but they have not been online for the rest of the world. If a page is only on your computer, you can't share an address to other people because your computer is not a server. A server is a special kind of computer that is always connected to the internet. The server sends pages to browsers when requested. To make your webpages available to the world, you need to store them on a server</p>
    
    <p>To store pages on a server, we use something called <em>FTP</em>, which stands for File Transfer Protocol. There are many different FTP programs, we will be using the built in FTP abilities of Windows.</p>
