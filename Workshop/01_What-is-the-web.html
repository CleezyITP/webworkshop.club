    <h1>What is the web?</h1>
    <h2>How does the web work?</h2>
    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>People access the web through software called a <em>web browser</em>, you've probably used one already. Let's break down the steps in how the browser renders a page.
        <ul>
            <li>A user either follows a link, opens a bookmark, or types in a <em>URL</em> in the address bar of their browser</li>
            <li>The browser makes a request to the network, which routes the request to the <em>web server</em> the resource is located on.</li>
            <li>the server replies with a page and any affiliated content (such as images, video files, styling, interactive scripts)</li>
            <li>When the browser receives the content, it reads through the files and renders the page and its content</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
    <p>Web servers are specialized computers that are always connected to the internet, and are configured to send web pages to browsers when requested. To operate a web server, you typically buy space from a <em>web hosting</em> company, but it is possible to host pages in other ways too.</p>
